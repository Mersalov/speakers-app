# Speakers Feature  (*CP*)

This repository will implement the first of two proposed solutions for building a scalable, enterprise-sized Angular application

 - [x] **Conservative Proposal (*CP*)**: Utilizing traditional Angular modules  
 - [ ] **Modern Proposal (*MP*)**: Leveraging standalone components and signals

> Architecture for ***CP*** will be based on a blend of best practices from **Angular for Enterprise Applications** - *Third Edition: Build scalable Angular apps using the minimalist Router-first architecture* and additional proven approaches from previous projects. These include methodologies such as the **View Layer with Smart & Dumb Components pattern**, which has been demonstrated to be both suitable and beneficial for large-scale Angular applications.
